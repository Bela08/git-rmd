# Why learn and use git/GitHub? 

- Version control
- Easy to share/distribute files, especially code/analyses
- Files accessible from anywhere with an internet connection
- Improves collaboration

_Git enables time travel & alternate realities!_

"Dropbox" for git-based projects on the internet. 

- share/store analyses and functions
- browse past versions of code
- browse source code ([CRAN](https://github.com/cran),  [tidyverse](https://github.com/tidyverse/), [rOpenSci](https://github.com/ropensci))
- use packages not on CRAN (`devtools::install_github("account/repo")`)

Take a moment to explore this repository: 

# https://github.com/isteves/typos

- When was the .xlarge[repository `r emo::ji("folder")`] first created?
- What .xlarge[commits `r emo::ji("ring")`] have been made to the repository?
- What .xlarge[issues `r emo::ji("x")`] have been submitted?
- What .xlarge[pull requests `r emo::ji("please")`] (PRs) have been submitted?

# What's the deal with projects?

Each project is a self-contained set of files. Projects make it **easy to transfer** files to another computer because its **boundaries are clearly defined**

.center[

# Use relative paths inside projects
 
- looks cleaner
- works for other people/computers

```{r eval = FALSE}
read.csv("data/eilat_survey_2017.csv")
#rather than
read.csv("C:/Maria×™/phd/thesis/reef_surveys/data/eilat_survey_2017.csv")

# __The different parts of Rmarkdown__
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ecodatasci-tlv/git-rmd/master/rmd_example.png" width=110%>

---
## YAML header 

- Must be enclosed in `---`
- output section changes based on the type of ducument

```r
---
title: "Edinburgh Biodiversity"
author: John Doe
date: 22/Oct/2016
output: html_document
---

```

---
## Code chunk

- The chunk must be enclosed between ` ``` ` and then `{r}` at the top
- keybord shortcut: ctrl + Alt + I (Windows) or cmd + Alt + I (MacOS)

<p><img src="img/rmarkdown_code.png" width=70%>

---
## __Plain text__

Here you write everything that isn't a code by using markdown related symbols to create headers, bold text , etc.

---
## __Workflow of Rmd file__

<p><img src="https://tinyurl.com/ycgusx7u" width=100%>

You create an Rmd file, then you knit it with knitr package, it is passed to one of the rendering packages like pandoc (for html) or LaTex (for pdf), and the final format is created

---
class: exercise

# __Practice time__

1. Open an Rmd file in the project you created before
2. Choose the type of document you want to create
3. Write some plain text and some analyses in the code chunk
4. Click on the knit botton at the top bar (or ctrl/cmd + shift + K)

---
__Congradulations!!!__ ðŸŽ‰ ðŸŽŠ ðŸ¥³ You created your first Rmd file!! `r emo::ji("smile")`

1. Turn on GitHub pages (from the repo home page, click Settings --> set source to _master branch_)
2. Check out your new web page!

## USERNAME.github.com/REPONAME

_Note:_ if your file was not named `index.html`, then you'll have to add `/FILENAME.html` to the end of the URL

---
# A few tricks

- Use `index.html` to set a home page for your repo: username.github.io/reponame = username.github.io/reponame/index.html
- use `toc_float` to add a floating table of contents to your RMarkdown webpage (more details [here](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/html-document.html))

# Let's collaborate!
---

# Contribute changes

If you want to work off of an existing repository on GitHub...

1. **Fork a repo** = make a copy of the repo on your account
2. **Make a branch** = start an alternate timeline
3. **Make a change**
4. **Examine the differences**

It's good practice to keep your "master" branch clean so that you can keep it synchronized with the original repository
---
class: exercise

# Your turn

1. Fork the repo = make a copy of the repo on your account
2. Make a branch = start an alternate timeline
3. Make and commit a change
4. Submit a pull request
---
# Collaborating on a single repo

Eventually, you'll have to start thinking about .xlarge[merge conflicts]. This is especially true when you start to collaborate on a single repostory.

If you edit the same line of code or text as your collaborator, you will need to _manually_ resolve the conflict.

---
class: exercise

# Work in pairs

1. Choose one of your repos
2. Go into `Settings` --> `Collaborators`. Add your neighbor as a collaborator
3. Accept the email invitation

# Make a change

1. The collaborator - create a new git repository in RStudio
2. Both - make and commit a change ON THE SAME LINE
3. Collaborator - PUSH the change
4. Repo owner - PULL
5. Repo owner - resolve the conflict, COMMIT, and PUSH
